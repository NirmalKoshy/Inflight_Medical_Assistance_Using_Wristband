# Inflight_Medical_Assistance_Using_Wristband
In my first project at Feynn Labs Consultancy Services, I applied machine learning to detect health anomalies during flights, focusing on early warning systems for passengers. My dataset wasn't from real-time wearable devices but simulated a similar scenario using historical health data. I processed information like heart rate, oxygen levels, blood pressure, and glucose levels to predict potential medical risks. This allowed me to simulate how, in real-world settings, wearables could help detect conditions such as fever or abnormal vitals, ensuring timely medical intervention and enhancing in-flight safety. This project highlighted the importance of integrating predictive health monitoring with airline systems.
