# Project Overview
This project aims to make flying safer by catching health problems before they become emergencies. Think of it as having a tiny doctor on your wrist during your flight! We've created a smart wristband that works with an app to keep an eye on passengers' health and alert flight crews if someone needs help.

## Why We Built This

About 1 in 604 flights has some kind of medical emergency

Current systems mostly rely on basic medical kits and crew training

Many health issues could be caught early with better monitoring

Quick response time is crucial during in-flight emergencies

## How It Works

### 1) Smart Wristband

Measures important health signs like:

Heart rate

Blood pressure

Oxygen levels

Blood sugar

Body temperature


Comfortable to wear throughout the flight

Battery lasts for the whole journey


### 2) Passenger App

Shows your health data in real-time

Sends alerts if something needs attention

Keeps your medical history private and secure

Easy to understand graphs and charts


### 3) Crew Dashboard

Shows health status of all passengers

Highlights anyone who might need help

Points to exact seat location of passengers needing attention

Gives step-by-step instructions for handling medical issues



## Cool Features

**Early Warning System:** Catches health issues before they become serious

**Smart Locations:** Uses Bluetooth to know exactly where each passenger is seated

**Privacy First:** All health data is encrypted and secure

**AI-Powered:** Uses machine learning to predict potential health issues

**Real-Time Updates:** Constant monitoring throughout the flight

## Benefits

### 1) For Passengers:

Peace of mind during flights

Quick help if needed

Private and secure health monitoring


### 2) For Airlines:

Better prepared for emergencies
